awful64 - Build and run "afulnx_64" (AMI Firmware Update Utility) v5.14.02.0026 on modern Linux kernels
(Tested on Alpine Linux with Linux Kernel 6.12)

Usage: ./awful64.sh ARGS...
for example:
        Display current ROM ID
	./awful64.sh /S

	Flash BIOS via UEFI Capsule
	./awful64.sh imageM1U.ROM /p /b /n /r /sp /capsule

Kernel module build instructions:

1. Download and unpack kernel driver
./prepare-DriverSource.sh

2. Build kernel driver
./build-DriverSource.sh <path-to-kernel-sources>

3. Load kernel driver
./insmod-amifldrv.sh

Prerequisites:

To build the kernel module, you need everything required to build a Linux kernel,
especially gcc and make, but also bison and flex.

The scripts automatically install the required packages for Alpine Linux (if running on such a system)

In order to extract the kernel module from the afulnx_64 binary, we briefly need root privileges.
The scripts call "sudo" to elevate privileges; please make sure your user has sudo access.
